# LIRI-NODE_APP ####

## Description
LIRI is a command line node app. It is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI takes in parameters as an input from users and gives user back data that is requested for. In this case, this will be a search in Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

LIRI understands and reponds to the following four commands:

#concert-this
                Search for an artist or band concert information


#spotify-this-song
                Search for an information about a song on Spotify


#movie-this 
                Search for a movie information on OMDB


#do-what-it-says 
                Reads the commands from a text file called random.txt
