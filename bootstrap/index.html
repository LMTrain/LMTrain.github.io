          <p>Welcome to my page. Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is LAYCON MURIZIQ (Please don't bite your tongue while trying to pronounce my last name :)). I am a married father of four children, ages from 13 years to 5 months. I have twins (a girl and a boy -13 years old), a girl 18 months old, and a baby boy 5 months old. They all keep me on my toes. My view of life, is having a good moral compass and it’s one of my utmost priority. One of my beliefs in life is to hold yourself accountable for your actions, with that in mind; I treat everyone around me as I want to be treated. My family comes first, and every other thing follows.</p>

      <p>To begin with, I have spent all my professional working life in IT industry. I have on my sleeve 24 years of IT related experience, from Hardware Technician, Software\Application Analyst, Information Security Analyst to Network Analyst. I have always being interested in writing computer programs. 
        I wrote my first code in QBasic Language towards the end of 1999. If you can recall, during that period, we are heading to the Year 2000 and there was this Millennium Bug issue about computer dates dating back to 1900. I wrote a program that tackles this issue. I call it "LM DATE CHECKER". 
        This program allows users to check dates 30,000 years (BC) back and 30,000 years (AD) forward. This date checker is good for Historians and Researchers who are interested in a date that matches the day. I still have this program, but unfortunate it will not run on any Windows machine from Windows XP upward.
        It runs only on Windows 3.1, 95, and 98. I also wrote a game program for brain exercise, which unfortunate has the same faith as the Date Checker, it can't run on modern Windows machine. So, here I am trying to rewrite the code in modern language, like Java to make it work on browsers.</p>

      <p>My interests are playing chess, listening to music, watching movies, painting/drawing, and going out with my family on vacation.</p>
